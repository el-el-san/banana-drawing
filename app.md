# Gemini Integration Writeup

**Banana Drawing** is an Android application that leverages Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model as the core engine for AI-powered creative image generation and interactive timeline management.

## Key Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Features:

**Image Generation (gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview)** serves as the primary engine, transforming text prompts into creative banana and cat illustrations. The app processes multimodal responses containing both generated images and descriptive text.

**Multimodal Understanding (gemini-2.5-flash-lite)** enables sophisticated image-text processing, handling multiple user-uploaded images simultaneously for complex compositions. This powers the interactive timeline system where users can sequence generated images at specific time positions (0-15 seconds).

**Enhanced Processing Pipeline** features two-stage prompt enhancement with automatic language translation, ensuring optimal generation quality. The app supports both direct image generation from text and context-aware editing of existing images through red-pen drawing tools.

**Timeline Integration** uniquely positions Gemini-generated images on an interactive timeline with drag-and-drop repositioning, playback controls (play/pause/loop), and variable speed playback. Users can build animated sequences by combining multiple AI-generated images with precise timing control.

The Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model is central to transforming user creativity into sequenced visual narratives, making it the first timeline-based AI image generation Android app powered entirely by Gemini technology.
